# Graphic-Design-iotum
For my first co-op term, I worked at a startup called iotum as their main QA/Technical Analyst. 
However when things weren't so chaotic, I helped out wherever I could. And this is the product of that.
1. FC = I updated and redesigned their main FreeConference User Guides using inDesign. I also created 5 new sub-User Guides. The main one is published here: https://content.freeconference.com/acton/attachment/29868/f-00cd/1/-/-/-/-/User%20Guide%20v3.pdf
2. Avatar = I proposed a new avatar feature where users can select pre-designed avatars for their profile pictures. I unfortunately did not have time to pursue this project but I had the prototypes all done.
